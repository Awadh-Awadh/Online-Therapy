        <div class="btncon"><p>Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous.
        Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline. But when stress lasts for a long time, it may harm your health.</p>
       <p>Stress is a normal feeling. There are two main types of stress:

        Acute stress. This is short-term stress that goes away quickly. You feel it when you slam on the brakes, have a fight with your partner, or ski down a steep slope. It helps you manage dangerous situations. It also occurs when you do something new or exciting. All people have acute stress at one time or another.
        Chronic stress. This is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, or trouble at work. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress. You can become so used to chronic stress that you don't realize it is a problem. If you don't find ways to manage stress, it may lead to health problems.</p>

          <p>you may have a medical condition if you switch from extremely happy to extremely depressed on a regular basis. If you have serious and frequent shifts in mood, you should tell your doctor about them. They can discuss the possible reasons for why you’re experiencing them.

            Some causes of rapid changes in behavior can be related to mental health, hormones, substance use, or other health conditions.
            
            When to see your doctor
            It’s common to experience a change in mood occasionally or to go through a short period of feeling elated or blue. But if your behavior is unpredictable for a number of days or longer, it may be a sign of something more serious.
            
            You may feel grumpy one minute and happy the next. You may also have emotions that can cause damage to your life.
            
            For example, you may:
            
            be so excitable that you find yourself unable to control urges to spend money, confront people, or engage in other uncontrollable or risky behaviors
            feel like you want to harm yourself or end your life
            be unable to visit friends, get enough sleep, go to work, or even get out of bed
            Patterns of these types of mood shifts may be symptoms of a more serious health condition. You should schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your feelings. They can work with you to determine why you feel this way and what you can do to resolve it.

          <div class="btncon2"><p>Low self-esteem is when someone lacks confidence about who they are and what they can do. They often feel incompetent, unloved, or inadequate. People who struggle with low self-esteem are consistently afraid about making mistakes or letting other people down.

            Having self-esteem issues can be detrimental to your health and negatively affect your personal and professional relationships. There are many reasons why you may have low self-esteem — your genes, how and where you grew up, and other life circumstances all play a role.
            
            A major factor of low self-esteem, however, comes from your own mental state. Your inner voice, or the thoughts in your head, can be constantly telling you that you are not good enough or worth anything, even if there is evidence to the contrary. Negative thinking in general is linked to low self-worth and low self-esteem.
            Signs of Low Self-Esteem
            There are several signs that either you or someone you know may be struggling with low self-esteem. Those signs of low self-esteem include:

            Sensitivity to Criticism

           If you have low self-esteem you may be extra sensitive to criticism, whether from others or yourself. You see it only as reinforcing your flaws and confirming that you are incapable of doing anything right.

           Social Withdrawal

          Declining invitations to go to a party or meet up with friends, canceling scheduled plans last-minute, and generally not wanting to be around others are signs of low self-esteem. You may not have any desire to hold a conversation or talk about your life because it will only reinforce the depression and anxiety you are already experiencing.

          Hostility

          For someone with low self-esteem, lashing out or becoming aggressive towards others is a defense mechanism. If you feel that you are about to be exposed or criticized, attacking whoever might criticize you can be a sign of low self-esteem.

          Excessive Preoccupation with Personal Problems

          Consistently worrying about your own personal issues takes up a lot of time for someone with low self-esteem. You may struggle to help or empathize with someone else’s problems because you are too preoccupied with your own.

          Physical Symptoms 

          Low self-esteem has been shown to lead to mental and physical health issues like depression, anxiety, and anorexia. It can also lead to unhealthy habits like smoking tobacco, alcohol abuse, or drug use.

           a group of persons united by the ties of marriage, blood, or adoption, constituting a single household and interacting with each other in their respective social positions, usually those of spouses, parents, children, and siblings. The family group should be distinguished from a household, which may include boarders and roomers sharing a common residence. It should also be differentiated from a kindred (which also concerns blood lines), because a kindred may be divided into several households. Frequently the family is not differentiated from the marriage pair, but the essence of the family group is the parent-child relationship, which may be absent from many marriage pairs.
           A survey showed that more than 80% of patients agreed that their mental health conditions had had a detrimental effect on their family.

         Mental health issues can be an extremely painful and traumatic time for all of the family and have huge impact on a family's financial and emotional components. When it comes to mental illness, the emotional and behavioural consequences for family members go largely ignored. It is clear that individuals' mental health problems have consequences for others within their social networks, most notably, their family.

          Looking after a family member with a mental illness can be an extremely stressful time and coping with the stress may rouse various reactions such as somatic problems (migraines, loss of appetite, fatigue, Sleep Therapy | Insomnia Treatment | Priory Group), cognitive and emotional problems (anxiety, depression, guilt, fear, anger, confusion) and behavioural troubles (changes in attitude, and social withdrawal).</p>

          Mental Health Issues Affect Businesses and Their Employees
          Poor mental health and stress can negatively affect employee:
          
          Job performance and productivity.
          Engagement with one’s work.
          Communication with coworkers.
          Physical capability and daily functioning.
          Mental illnesses such as depression are associated with higher rates of disability and unemployment.
          
          Depression interferes with a person’s ability to complete physical job tasks about 20% of the time and reduces cognitive performance about 35% of the time.11
          Only 57% of employees who report moderate depression and 40% of those who report severe depression receive treatment to control depression symptoms.12
          Even after taking other health risks—like smoking and obesity—into account, employees at high risk of depression had the highest health care costs during the 3 years after an initial health risk assessment.13,14

        <div class="btncon6"><p>Any of us may occasionally feel a lack of meaning or purpose, as well as a feeling of isolation. These feelings can accompany other feelings of low mood, and vanish when our mood changes.

          But if our lack of meaning and purpose last for an extended period, the following may be contributing factors:
          
          Unemployment
          Lack of meaningful activity
          Difficult social circumstances
          Lack of spirituality
          Feeling powerless
          Adverse childhood experiences
          Psychological trauma
          Bereavement
          How a lack of meaning and purpose can affect our mental health
          Meaning and purpose often go hand-in-hand with feelings of empowerment, mastery, and control.
          
          One major study, on people aged between 55 and 85, showed that those who reported the highest levels of personal ‘mastery’ – feelings of control over life-events – had an almost 60% smaller chance of death than those who felt relatively helpless.[11]
          
          A perceived lack of meaning or purpose are common contributors to and symptoms of mental health difficulties, including:
          
          Depression
          Depression is commonly associated with feeling purposeless, apathetic and isolated.
          
          A perceived lack of meaning can also contribute to and accompany low motivation, intense feelings of sadness, social isolation, and a lack of interest in activities you previously enjoyed. These are all well-known symptoms of depression.</p>

          <div class="btncon7"><p> Procrastination is a very common aspect of depression.
          Procrastination and stress are associated with poorer mental health, health problems, and treatment delay. We examine procrastination in the domain of mental health. Higher levels of procrastination and stress were predicted to correlate with poorer mental health status and fewer mental health help-seeking behaviours. Undergraduate participants (135 females, 65 males) completed online questionnaires on procrastination, stress, mental health issues, and mental health help-seeking behaviours. Three significant canonical correlations were obtained between the predictor variables of procrastination, stress, (with controls for age, gender, and social desirability) and the criterion mental health variables. The first canonical correlation supported the main hypothesis associating stress and procrastination with poorer mental health. The second suggested that greater age and female gender are positively correlated to mental health help-seeking. The third canonical correlation depicted reduced procrastination and reduced concern for social desirability as associated with a pattern of poorer mental health and increased mental health help-seeking behaviours. These findings are discussed with a view to addressing the discrepancy between the considerable extent of mental health suffering and the comparatively low levels of mental health help-seeking.

            <p>When you feel confident you tend to make decisions that are good for you and your health. You are more likely to take care of yourself, get out and about, be active, and choose healthier foods. Confidence can also give you a positive outlook on life, increasing your mental and emotional wellbeing.

            However, when your confidence is low, your feelings of self-worth and self-respect may also suffer. You may not care how others treat you or how you treat yourself. You may not care about what you eat or how you spend your time, and this can start to affect your health.
            
            It can also be hard to make decisions and face challenges when your confidence is low. You may start to doubt yourself and what you can achieve. Meeting new people or trying new things may become more difficult. You might worry about saying or doing the wrong thing and so you start to hide away and avoid things. This avoidance behaviour can lead to a negative cycle, lowering your confidence even more.
